## WHAT WE COLLECT

### Self-Custody of Personal and Transaction Data

We offer the Services to enable you to self-custody your Tari and similarly seek for you to self-custody your personal information and transaction history.  Accordingly, the information we collect about you is very limited and generally for the purpose of providing and improving the Services we offer to you.

### Active Collection of Information

We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, if you opt in to receiving communications from Tari Labs via email, we may collect your name and email address. We retain this information until you ask to be unsubscribed from our list(s). If you purchase any products from Tari Labs, we may collect shipping information (such as name and mailing address) from you in order to ship the products to you. We do not sell or otherwise transmit any such actively-collected personal information to third parties other than to third party service providers discussed in Section 4.

### Passive Collection of Information

When you use the Services, some information about your visit is automatically collected. This information includes your IP address, access times, browser type and language, and referring web site addresses.  We collect this information to troubleshoot technical issues, understand how visitors use the Services, provide an experience relevant to the general location associated with your IP address, and to make improvements to our website.

If you arrive at our website by clicking a link, then we may capture information that tracks your visit from that link.

We may share information with those who need it to do work for us. These recipients may include third party companies and individuals to administer and provide the Services on our behalf (such as customer support, hosting, email delivery and database management services), as well as lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers.  We will only provide these third parties with your personal information to the limited extent necessary to deliver the services.

We will obtain consent for such sharing with service providers where legally required. We enter into written agreements with these third-party service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection for your personal information as provided under this Policy and limiting their use of your personal information to the specified services provided on our behalf. Such service providers include:

- _Shopify._ We use Shopify&#39;s e-commerce platform to facilitate your purchases made from our website. Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall and encrypts your credit/debit card information in compliance with PCI DSS standards. You can review Shopify&#39;s privacy policy at [shopify.com/legal/privacy](http://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy).

The Company has offices, affiliates and service providers both inside and outside of the United States and in other countries. Your personal information may be transferred to or from the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

EU users should read the important information provided  below about transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

## HOW INFORMATION IS SECURED

We retain information we collect as long as it is necessary and relevant to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. In addition, we retain personal information to comply with applicable law where required, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our User Agreement, and other actions permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

We employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all information submitted through the Services. However, the security of information transmitted through the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of data. Users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the security of any user credentials or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of the Services. In order to protect you and your data, we may suspend your use of any of the Services, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected.

Some of the information you provide us may constitute sensitive data as defined in the GDPR (also referred to as special categories of personal information), including identification of your race or ethnicity on government-issued identification documents.

### Legal Bases for Processing

We only use your personal information as permitted by law. We are required to inform you of the legal bases of our processing of your personal information, which are described below.

### Legal basis for processing personal information under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Tari Labs&#39; legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

Tari Labs may process your personal information because:

- We need to perform a contract with you;
- You have given us permission to do so;
- The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights; and
- To comply with the law.

These processing activities constitute our legitimate interests. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impacts on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by any adverse impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

### Retention of data

Tari Labs will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

Tari Labs will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.



### Use for New Purposes

We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy, where we are permitted by law to do so and where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis for that use. If we have relied upon your consent for a particular use of your personal information, we will seek your consent for any unrelated purpose.

## YOUR RIGHTS

Under the GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. You may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or response to your requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us at privacy@tarilabs.com or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.
