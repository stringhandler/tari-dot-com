## 6. THE WALLET

6.1 Description

6.1.1 The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet. The Wallet is only capable of supporting Tari.  Under no circumstances should you attempt to store virtual currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.

6.1.2 When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any Tari via the Tari Network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR EMOJI ID, PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access Tari previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Tari. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf.

6.2 Your Wallet

Your Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to self-custody your Tari.  Among other things, this means that:

6.2.1 As the owner of Tari in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Tari. Tari Labs shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Tari held in your Wallet.

6.2.2 You control the Tari held in your Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Tari by sending it to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer Tari into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so.

6.3 Risk Disclosures Relating to Your Wallet

6.3.1 In order to be completed, any Tari or tXTR transaction created with the Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the Tari ledger associated with the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet. The Tari Network and Tari Testnet are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Tari Labs.

6.3.2 Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the Tari Network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Tari Network. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in Tari or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.

6.3.3 Once transaction details have been submitted to the Tari Network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.

6.4 Forks

In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, Tari Labs may not be able to support activity related to your Tari. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Tari Labs is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network disruption.

6.5 No Password Recovery

6.5.1 With respect to the Wallet, Tari Labs does not receive or store a backup of your Wallet credentials, including, without limitation, your Emoji Id, passphrases, identifiers, backup phrases, private keys and network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet credentials retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet credentials. Any Tari you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret your Wallet credentials. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of Tari in your Wallet.

6.5.2 When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep secret all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

6.6 Fees

Tari Labs does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling Tari. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation &quot;miner&#39;s fees&quot;) required to use the Tari Network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and Tari Labs shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.

## 7. TARI TESTNET

7.1 By using the Tari Testnet and Testnet Wallet you agree to these terms and acknowledge and agree that the Tari Testnet and platform is in development and that use of the Tari Testnet is entirely at your sole risk. You agree to use the Testnet and Testnet Wallet for testing purposes only and understand that Testnet Wallets may be periodically wiped without warning.  You further acknowledge and agree that all information and materials published, distributed or otherwise made available on the Tari Testnet are provided for non-commercial, personal use only.

7.2 No party involved in, or having contributed to the development of, the Tari Testnet including any of their affiliates, directors, employees, contractors, service providers or agents (the Parties Involved) accepts any responsibility or liability to you or any third parties in relation to any materials or information accessed or downloaded via the Tari Testnet.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Parties Involved are not responsible for any damage to your computer systems, loss of data, or any other loss or damage resulting (directly or indirectly) from use of the Tari Testnet.

7.3 To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Parties Involved have any liability whatsoever to any person for any direct or indirect loss, liability, cost, claim, expense or damage of any kind, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of all or part of the Tari Testnet.

7.4 The Tari TestNet is not yet 100% complete or stable.  The network may be restarted, possibly multiple times, causing all Testnet Wallets to be wiped.

## 8. tXTR

8.1 Your use of the Tari Testnet involves the use of tXTR.

8.2 Allocation.

Upon your successful creation of a Tari Wallet, you may be allocated an initial amount of tXTR.  We may allocate additional tXTR to you at our sole discretion upon your request.  We may at any time vary the amount of tXTR to be allocated to you.

8.3 Limited License.

You do not own any tXTR that you may be allocated or that you may otherwise receive.   Instead, you receive a limited license to use such tXTR on the Tari Testnet.  Tari Labs may terminate your license to use tXTR at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion without notice, refund, or compensation.  Tari Labs is not responsible for replacing tXTR or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that your ability to use tXTR is terminated, lost or damaged, or for any other reason.  You agree that Tari Labs will have no liability to you based on its exercise of its rights with respect to tXTR.

8.4 Usage.

tXTR may only be used for Tari Testnet system resources. Any tXTR allocated to you must only be used by you and not by any third party. All tXTR can be used solely for the TariTestnet within the Tari Testnet environment and you shall not use any tXTR or the Tari Testnet in any manner that increases your allocation or consumption of tXTR or Tari Testnet resources to the detriment of other users.

8.5 Temporary in Nature.

All tXTR are temporary in nature and can only be used for a limited period of time that is stipulated by us. We also reserve the right to void any tXTR allocated to any user any time as we wish.

8.6 Value

tXTR has no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash, cash equivalent, or other tokens or cryptocurrencies. You shall not attach any value to any tXTR and you are prohibited from using any tXTR for any purposes other than to access and use the Tari Testnet. Without limitation, you must not, and must not permit any person to, trade tXTR with any third party for any purpose, make tXTR available for trade on any cryptocurrency exchange, offer tXTR for rent, lease, sale, or trade in any manner, or attempt to do any of the foregoing.  The amount of tXTR received is subject to our sole discretion at all times.  tXTR has no monetary value and may not be sold under any circumstances.  Neither use of the Tari Testnet nor receipt of any Tari thereon gives any user any right to receive Tari or anything else in the future (on the Tari Mainnet or otherwise).  Your balance of Tari on the Tari Testnet will not transfer to the Tari Mainnet.

8.7 Modification

We may from time to time add, modify, or remove any feature, functionality, or usability of any Testnet Token.

## 9. AIRDROP PROGRAM

9.1 Description

We may offer you the opportunity to receive Tari or tXTR at no cost ( **Airdrop** ), subject to the terms described in this section. The Airdrop Program is provided to you exclusively by Tari Labs.

9.2 Terms of Airdrop Program

9.2.1 No Purchase Necessary

9.2.2 Timing

Each Airdrop shall be subject to any terms displayed in the Services.

9.2.3 Limited Supply

An offer to receive Tari and/or tXTR in an Airdrop is only available to you while supplies last.

Tari Labs reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or suspend any Airdrop requirements at any time without notice, including the amount previously advertised as available.

9.2.4 Eligibility

You are solely responsible for researching and understanding the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet subject to the Airdrop. You may not rely on any of our statements concerning the foregoing.

## 10. GENERAL RISK FACTORS

Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list some, but not all of these risks below:

* a) Hardware, software or connections required to interact with the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet might fail, succumb to malware, unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Third parties may obtain unauthorized access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and private keys.

IN NO EVENT SHALL TARI LABS, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE TARI ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO US BY YOU OR BY YOU TO US IN CONNECTION WITH A TARI TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON ITS DISPLAYED TERMS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, VALUED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION; OR (B) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF TARI LABS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR EXAMPLE (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER TYPES OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER TO YOU ANY TARI AS DAMAGES, MAKE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR ANY OTHER REMEDY. IF YOU WOULD BASE YOUR CALCULATIONS OF DAMAGES IN ANY WAY ON THE VALUE OF TARI, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE CALCULATION SHALL BE BASED ON THE LOWEST VALUE OF THE TARI DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE ACCRUAL OF THE CLAIM AND THE AWARD OF DAMAGES.

WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY (A) THE MALFUNCTION, UNEXPECTED FUNCTION OR UNINTENDED FUNCTION OF ANY COMPUTER OR THE TARI NETWORK, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK FORKS, REPLAY ATTACKS, DOUBLE-SPEND ATTACKS, SYBIL ATTACKS, 51% ATTACKS, GOVERNANCE DISPUTES, MINING DIFFICULTY, CHANGES IN CRYPTOGRAPHY OR CONSENSUS RULES, HACKING OR CYBERSECURITY BREACHES; (B) THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY; (C) ANY CHANGE IN LAW, REGULATION OR POLICY, OR (D) FORCE MAJEURE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE.

13.7 Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tari Labs, its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, managers, members, officers, and employees from any and all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable legal fees, arising out of or relating to your or any other person&#39;s use of your credentials or Wallet in connection with: (a) use of the Tari Labs Site or Services; (b) breach of this User Agreement or any other policy;

## 15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR UNITED STATES USERS

15.1 Disputes

If you live in the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner) shall be settled in binding arbitration, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act under the American Arbitration Association&#39;s rules; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement will waive, preclude or otherwise limit your right to (i) bring an individual action in a US small claims court or (ii) file a representative action solely to obtain a public injunction.

15.2 Arbitration

The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys&#39; fees when authorized by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court.

You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys&#39; fees. If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with California law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in Oakland, California, applying California law.

15.3 No Trial by Jury

By entering into this User Agreement, you expressly waive your right to a trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit.

## 16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-US USERS

If you live outside of the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business outside of the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner), the courts located in Oakland, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such dispute, and will hear the dispute under California law.
