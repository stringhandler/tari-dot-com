The following notable pull requests were merged into development this week:


### Monitor and display warning for min ratio for TCPv4 nodes ([#3953](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues/3953))

Every base node has it's own public key and address, which is either an IPv4 address or Tor hidden service onion address. Onion addresses are essentially costless to create and advertise, so a malicious user can create
many different nodes very quickly, quicker than an honest base node could ban them. IP addresses are not as easy to acquire and there's a limited number of them.

For now, this is only a warning. In future, Tari may add minimum restrictions on how many IP4 peers it keeps.

### Add UTXO set size to base node metrics ([#3932](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues/3932))

The Tari base node exposes a number of metrics which can be used to create dashboards in [Grafana] with [Prometheus].

To enable the metric, run the base node with the following:

`tari_base_node --metrics-bind-addr 127.0.0.1:1234`

Where `127.0.0.1:1234` is your [Prometheus instance].
