This week sees a number of stability improvements to the network and wallet. If you're running an Esmeralda testnet node, you will notice that there are significantly more transactions in the blockchain. That's because [@hansieodendaal](https://github.com/hansieodendaal) and [@SWvheerden](https://github.com/SWvheerden) have been stress testing the network. A number of bugs and performance tweaks have been fixed and implemented as an outcome of this process. 

For those not following in Discord, there was a discussion about creating a Stagenet. More details on how Stagenet differs from previous testnets are in the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/blob/development/Contributing.md#testnets).
