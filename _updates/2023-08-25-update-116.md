Are you interested in contributing to Tari? Taking part in a cryptocurrency project can seem daunting, but we're here to help make it more accessible. To assist newcomers, we've developed a  [Reviewer's Guide](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/5664) to help you get started. While not an exhaustive set of rules, this guide aims to orient new contributors towards considering potential vulnerabilities during both code creation and pull request reviews.

With the current code audits continuing and as we get closer to a release candidate, it is vitally important to find bugs and vulnerabilities.

In addition to the reviewer's guide, we've started creating some [diagrams](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/5651) to help new developers get aquainted to the codebase. Diagramming a whole system will take a while, so it's a work in progress right now, but we'll keep adding.
