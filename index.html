              Tari is a highly versatile blockchain protocol built in Rust. It is ultra-high performance, infinitely
              scalable, open source, and has unique confidentiality features that keep users safe and enable vast new
              use cases.

            <p>
              Tari exists because creators, entrepreneurs, and developers want it to.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            A goal of the Tari community is for developers of any skill level to be able to quickly build useful
            applications that leverage the Tari network and contribute to the Tari project.
            <br /><br />
            The best way to get started is to start running a Tari node. A Tari node is the basic building block of the
            Tari blockchain and network. Nodes perform the critical functions of maintaining the ledger. Without nodes,
            there is no network.

          </p>
          <h2>Why Run a Node</h2>
          <p>
            Every new node increases the size of the Tari network and contributes to network security. There are many
            things that you can do with the Tari base node client:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mine testnet Tari (tXTR)</li>
            <li>
              Transact using the CLI wallet
            </li>
            <li>
              Query and analyze chain data using your local copy of the ledger
            </li>
            <li>
              Build applications that leverage chain data, such as block explorers, analytics tools, and more
            </li>

          <h3>How to Run Your Own Node</h3>
          <p>It’s incredibly easy to set up your own Tari base node. There are two ways to accomplish this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads">Download the binaries</a> and follow the installation instructions
              on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari#">GitHub</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build your own set of binaries from the base node source code by following these instructions on the <a
                target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari#">GitHub</a> repo
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Have questions? The Tari community prides itself on being open and inclusive. <strong>There are no dumb
              questions</strong>.
            The best places to engage with the Tari developer community are on IRC or <a href="https://discord.gg/tari"

          <h3>Spending testnet Tari (tXTR)</h3>
          <p>What can you do with tXTR besides experimenting with transactions? You can “spend” your hard-earned,
            infinite supply, fake Tari on exclusive one-of-a-kind items in the TTL (Tari Testnet Limited) store*.
            Everything in the store is denominated in tXTR (and is therefore free) except for shipping costs.
            Check it out <a href="https://store.tarilabs.com" target="_blank">here</a> and let folks know what you think
            on <a href="https://discord.gg/tari" target="_blank">Discord</a> or IRC.</p>
          <p class="disclaimer" style="opacity: .7; font-size: 12px; margin-top: -20px;">* tXTR has no monetary value
            and cannot be exchanged for cash, cash equivalent, or other tokens or cryptocurrencies.</p>

              Tari will always be a work in progress.

          </div>
          <p>The Tari community believes that it needs to continually improve and evolve to achieve its stated goal: to
            be the most useful decentralized platform that empowers anyone to create digitally scarce things people
            love. How does it improve? Because people choose to dedicate their time, creativity, and brilliance to
            working on the project.

                improve your skills. The Tari community is open, inclusive, and helpful.</p>

              <p>The Tari community believes that the world is out of balance. The internet is an incredible blessing
                for society, but there are tradeoffs. One of those tradeoffs is confidentiality. The only way to solve
                this imbalance is to build new layers of the internet that have meaningful confidentiality features and
                keep users safe. The Tari network will be such a layer. Want to learn more about the decisions the
                community has made so far?
                Please visit the Tari GitHub repos, and connect with us on Discord or IRC. The Tari community is low
                ego, doesn’t believe in not invented here syndrome, and believes that great ideas can come from
                anywhere. We’d love to hear your feedback and collaborate with you to make Tari the most useful protocol
                in the world.</p>

          <h3>What Makes Tari Unique?</h3>
          <p>
            What sets Tari apart is the Tari community's relentless drive to create a protocol that turns
            confidentiality features as an advantage to enable tinkerers and creators to build more useful applications.
            Through composable templates that make it easier for developers to create successful applications, beautiful
            user experience patterns, and reference designs that help developers obfuscate complexity, the Tari protocol
            is built for the real world.
          </p>

          <h3>Get Involved</h3>
          <p>Tari is an ecosystem of projects. Each project varies in complexity and sophistication. Some projects are
            easy to get started contributing to, and others have a meaningful learning curve. The common thread that
            runs through all Tari projects is that we (the Tari community) are united in making Tari useful, conducting
            ourselves in a low ego manner, and warmly welcoming everyone regardless of skill level or background.

          <h3>The Beginning of Your Journey</h3>
          <p>The Tari project is undergoing continuous evolution. As a result there are always issues to tackle and
            improvements to make. The Tari community makes an effort to maintain a number of open issues that are a good
            place to start for new contributors. These issues are labeled in Tari project repos as “good first issue”
            and are usually refreshed every few months. Have questions? Please feel free to ask any question you have in
            #tari-dev on Libera.Chat, or on <a href="https://discord.gg/tari" target="_blank">Discord#dev</a>. </p>

          <h3>Protocol Issues</h3>
          <p>Oftentimes new contributors start with documentation related issues that tend to be quick wins and help
            them understand the protocol in greater detail before moving towards test writing and focusing on core
            protocol code. But feel free to choose your own adventure

          <p>What is a Tari digital asset? It is a programmable canvas for telling stories.</p>
        </div>
        <p>It can be a legendary collectible like the sword of Excalibur, shrouded in a misty forest waiting for the
          right person to discover it and wield it in battle. Or it can be a coveted ticket that grants access to a
          sold-out concert, and then access to a personal message from an iconic artist. It can also be a token that
          represents the economic unit for a new virtual world.

        <p>
          A Tari digital asset can be truly digitally scarce. Someone can prove that they own it in a verifiable manner,
          and trust that it cannot be easily copied. They can be as secure in their ownership of an asset as they are
          about any material thing they possess. And a Tari digital asset can have rules that stay with it for as long
          as it matters. For example, every time an asset changes hands, the creator may choose to receive a fraction of
          the transaction. The Tari community is designing the Tari protocol to support all of these use cases and more.

        <h2>How does Tari help creators?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create new, permanent revenue streams around your creations. For example, earn revenue every time your
            creation is transferred from one party to another</li>
          <li>Turn your creations into programmable, evolving keys that can unlock anything now or in the future. For
            example, a creation issued today can unlock access, an experience, or a new creation in the future</li>
          <li>Build deeper connections with your fans by enabling them to truly own your creations while retaining
            influence and opportunity via rulesets</li>
          <li>Create digital things that stand the test of time. As long as the Tari blockchain exists, records of your
            creation will persist</li>
